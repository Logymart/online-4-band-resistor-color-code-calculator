## Features

- **Quick Calculations**: Get resistance values instantly by selecting color bands.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use with clear visuals.
- **Accurate Results**: Trustworthy calculations based on standard resistor color codes.
- **Educational Tool**: Great for learning about resistors and color codes.
- **Accessible Online**: No installation required; just use your browser.

## How It Works

The calculator uses a simple method to determine the resistance value of a 4-band resistor. Each color corresponds to a specific number. The first two bands represent significant digits, the third band is the multiplier, and the fourth band indicates tolerance. 

### Color Code Table

| Color     | Digit | Multiplier | Tolerance |
|-----------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Black     | 0     | 1          | -         |
| Brown     | 1     | 10         | Â±1%       |
| Red       | 2     | 100        | Â±2%       |
| Orange    | 3     | 1,000      | -         |
| Yellow    | 4     | 10,000     | -         |
| Green     | 5     | 100,000    | Â±0.5%     |
| Blue      | 6     | 1,000,000  | Â±0.25%    |
| Violet    | 7     | -          | Â±0.1%     |
| Gray      | 8     | -          | -         |
| White     | 9     | -          | -         |
| Gold      | -     | 0.1        | Â±5%       |
| Silver    | -     | 0.01       | Â±10%      |

### Example Calculation

If you have a resistor with the following color bands: Red, Red, Brown, and Gold:

- **First Band (Red)**: 2
- **Second Band (Red)**: 2
- **Third Band (Brown)**: Multiplier of 10
- **Fourth Band (Gold)**: Tolerance of Â±5%

The resistance value is calculated as:
```
(22) * (10) = 220 Ohms Â±5%
```
